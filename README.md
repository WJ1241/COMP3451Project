## Royal Infirmary Relic Recovery

Royal Infirmary Relic Recovery (abbreviated as RIRR from now on) is a game produced for the Advanced Game Design & Engineering module when studying at the University of Worcester, and was developed with students on the Game Art course. 'Team Orbital' was the programming team, and 'The Undecided' was the art team.

### Setting
RIRR is set in the Infirmary and on the Worcester City campus and surrounding area in 2006. The player will learn about the artefacts in the infirmary as they recover them throughout the game. They will go about recovering the items by traversing the levels in a stealthy manner to avoid conflict with the infected NPCâ€™s. The player will collect one relic on each level, some of which will present the player with a boon or upgrade. The final confrontation will be with your supposed friend Geoff on the roof of the museum building, for a boss battle of epic proportions when the protagonist anticlimactically knocks Geoff into a hell portal where his fate is left unknown and returns to his job as if nothing happened.
